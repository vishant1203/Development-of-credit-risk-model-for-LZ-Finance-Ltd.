# Development of Credit Risk Model for LZ Finance

Project Overview: LZ Finance, a Non-Banking Financial Company (NBFC) based in India, is partnering with "LIVIS ai", a leading AI service provider, to develop a sophisticated credit risk model. This model will include a credit scorecard that categorizes loan applications into Poor, Average, Good, and Excellent categories, based on criteria similar to the CIBIL scoring system.

## Scope of Work: 

- [Phase 1: Development and Implementation]
  - --1. **Model Development**: Build a predictive model using LZ Financeâ€™s dataset which includes historical loan data and default  
         indicators. 
  - --2. **Scorecard Creation**: Develop a scoring system that categorizes credit scores into Poor, Average, Good, and Excellent. 
  - --3. **Streamlit UI Application**: Develop a user-friendly interface where loan officers can input borrower demographics, loan details,
